# GuessTheChampion (Console version)

A guessing style game where the user will try to guess a League of Legends champion, by asking questions in the console.

The questions are answered by Googles Gemini 2.0 Flash model, and thus all champions released after August 2024 are not supported (Aurora being the latest).
